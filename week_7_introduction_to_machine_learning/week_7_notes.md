It's important to get practice with the programming concepts of the week.  If you haven't already done so, please download the notebooks for this week and work through the examples.

If you want to practice and test your knowledge by developing other notebooks, you can access these by signing up for the Verified Certificate program -- for those looking to more robustly document their knowledge and skills.  This can also put you on the path to earning a MicroMasters in Data Science, if that would be helpful to you!
