- We will now start using the Twitter Python package
which simplifies access to the API.
By the end of this video, you should be able to
install the Twitter Python package
and authenticate successfully with the Twitter API.
Okay, in the next code block,
we'll use the Twitter object we started
and we start working with the Twitter API
to create a new object called authentication, or auth.
Here we have our A-U-T-H, the auth.
We will use this authentication to create
a Twitter API object.
So what we've done is, we called twitter.
We imported twitter package in Python first.
We called twitter and used the auth function
to create the authentication object, or that class creation.
And then we'll now use the Twitter API
to use this authentication
and create a Twitter API object.
This object is what we will use to start
accessing the data via the Twitter API.
Let's run this.
As you see here, the type of that object is Twitter,
so it's a part of that Twitter class,
for your Twitter account.
