## Notebook: Coding Practice
Bookmark this page
It's important to get practice with the programming concepts of the week.  If you haven't already done so, please download the notebooks for this week and work through the examples.

If you want to practice and test your knowledge by developing other notebooks, you can access these by signing up for the Verified Certificate program -- for those looking to more robustly document their knowledge and skills.  This can also put you on the path to earning a MicroMasters in Data Science, if that would be helpful to you!

If you want some more practice with regular expressions (regex), you can read more here and here.

## Extra Video: Pandas Efficiency - Resource
Bookmark this page
There was a presentation at PyCon 2017 which was particularly relevant for you now that you've been introduced to pandas and numpy.  In particular, it highlights some best practices for writing efficient code when working with pandas.  Watching the video is completely optional, but we encourage you to check it out.
