- Let's start our live coding session on data cleaning.
So, we'll first look at the shape of movies data frame
using the shape function here.
Remember, we loaded that movies.csv
into a data frame called movies
and if we run the shape function here,
it gives us a number of rows and columns in the data frame.
So, we see that there's about 27,000 rows,
records that means, of movies.
Next, we'll check if any row has no values
in any of our data frames.
Here,
we use the isnull function first.
So, what I'll do is movies.isnull.
This isnull function run on the whole data frame
will give us a boolean data frame.
For movies the data frame will be composed
of three series
for each column for user ID, movie ID and rating.
And then we'll check if any of those values
are true.
All of them are false, which is great,
that means we have no null values
in the movies dataset.
So,
we'll do the same exercise for ratings.
We'll check if any of the values in the ratings is null.
They are not.
All the columns have
values in them.
There are no missing values.
And as we go through the same steps for tags,
the third data frame we built,
we'll notice that in tags
there's a true value.
Instead of all three falses,
we notice the tag column has some missing values,
some NAN values in there.
So, as you have seen
this is a relatively clean data set
but tags column has indeed some values.
Let's try to drop those.
We will use the dropna function
with the default option of eliminating records,
rows with missing values in access zero
or simply rows with NAN values in them.
So, we'll say tags equals tags.dropna
and run that.
And let's do that same check on isnull on tags.
We'll see all three
return false.
So, we successfully got rid of those null values
or NAN values, missing values in tags.
Remember when we ran the shape of tags,
we noticed there were 465,564 rows,
records in there.
Let's run the same shape and see if we indeed removed
some of them.
Looks like we removed now.
There's 465,548 rows, records
and looks like we really removed 16 rows
with missing data values in them.
Okay, let's stop here and see how we can explore
this dataset through simple visualizations in Pandas next.
