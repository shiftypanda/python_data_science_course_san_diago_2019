### Elegance
* Elegance of presenting of findings, map overlay colour scheme clear display of information rather than numerics
* focus on what is relevant
* be stylish if possible

* easy to produce quick plots of data
matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible

lots of other tools
seaborn, ggplot, altair, bokeh, plotly, folium

## Visualization Libraries

The following list provides a few plotting libraries for you to get started based on their use case(s).  This list is focused on providing a few solid options for each case rather than overwhelming you with the variety of options available.

The foundation: Matplotlib, most used plotting library, best for two-dimensional non-interactive plots. A possible replacement is pygal, it provides similar functionality but generates vector graphics SVG output and has a more user-friendly interface.

Specific use cases:

Specialized statistical plots, like automatically fitting a linear regression with confidence interval or like scatter plots color-coded by category.

seaborn: it builds on top of Matplotlib and it can also be used as a replacement for matplotlib just for an easier way to specify color palettes and plotting aestetics
Grammar of graphics plotting, if you find the interface of Matplotlib too verbose, Python provides packages based on a different paradigm of plot syntax based on R's ggplot2

ggplot: it provides similar functionality to Matplotlib and is also based on Matplotlib but provides a different interface.
altair: it has a simpler interface compared to ggplot and generates Javascript based plots easily embeddable into the Jupyter Notebook or exported as PNG.
Interactive plots, i.e. pan, zoom that work in the Jupyter Notebooks but also can be exported as Javascript to work standalone on a webpage.

bokeh: maintained by Continuum Analytics, the company behind Anaconda
plotly: is both a library and a cloud service where you can store and share your visualizations (it has free/paid accounts)
Interactive map visualization

*folium: Creates HTML pages that include the Leaflet.js javascript plotting library to display data on top of maps. *plotly: it supports color-coded country/world maps embedded in the Jupyter Notebook.

Realtime plots that update with streaming data, even integrated in a dashboard with user interaction.

bokeh plot server: it is part of Bokeh but requires to launch a separate Python process that takes care of responding to events from User Interface or from streaming data updates.
3D plots are not easy to interpret, it is worth first consider if a combination of 2D plots could provide a better insight into the data

## Notebook: Coding Practice

It's important to get practice with the programming concepts of the week.  If you haven't already done so, please download the notebooks for this week and work through the examples.

If you are wanting to practice and test your knowledge by developing other notebooks, you can access these by signing up for the Verified Certificate program -- for those looking to more robustly document their knowledge and skills.  This can also put you on the path to earning a MicroMasters in Data Science, if that would be helpful to you!

One of the pioneering educators of Data Visualization, Professor Hans Rosling's videos on world development have inspired a whole generation of data scientists.  Please feel free to watch this short clip from BBC below:

200 Countries, 200 Years, 4 Minutes - The Joy of Stats

Hans Rosing passed away February 7, 2017.  We encourage you to read more about his life and achievements in his obituary.
