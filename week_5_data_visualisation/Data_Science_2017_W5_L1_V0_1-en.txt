- Data visualization is one of the primary skills
of any data scientist,
hence value cannot be understated.
However, it's also a large field in itself.
There are a number of graduate courses
at universities and design labs around the country
just focused on data visualization.
So, this week is really just an introduction
to a much, much broader topic.
For the introduction,
we'll first spend some time
looking at data visualization conceptually,
then we'll dive right into making some visualization
using Python libraries.
Lastly, we'll take a look at some particularly effective
data visualizations and their impact.
I will also mention that if this area
is interesting to you and you want to lean more,
we'll be sure to provide links to textbooks
and other resources on data visualization.
